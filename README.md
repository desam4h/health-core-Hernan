Health Analytics is a beta project that provides services required by M4H:
  - Load/Unload statistical information
  - Generate health events
  - Notify about periodical events.

### Tech
Health Analytics uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Angular4] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - Just required by Angular.
* [Spring Boot] - To configure the backend services
* [MongoDB] - NoSQL database. 

###### Subprojects
* health_core: Backend services in Java, Spring and MongoDB
* health_ui: Frontend services in Angular.


### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd health_analytics
